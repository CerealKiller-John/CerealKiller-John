- 👋 Hi, I’m @CerealKiller-John
- 👀 I’m interested in Linux and learning terminal inside and out.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Linux "hard mode" working on my first (non-dual boot install) of Linux and I decided to install Arch Linux.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any project I can help with, both in QoL ideas, and coding later on after I learn more.
